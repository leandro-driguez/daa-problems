Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)

This is a school project for the subject Design and Analysis of Algorithms of the Computer Science course at the University of Havana. The project consists of solving 3 different complex problems in order to demonstrate good skills in the design and analysis of algorithms created to solve the problems. This involves demonstrating the correctness of the ideas, calculating the time and space complexity and demonstrating as far as possible whether or not the solution is optimal. 

One of the problems, "the chaos", was intended to demonstrate our knowledge of NP-problems, where we had to prove that the problem in question was actually NP-complete and find some good polynomial approximations to the solution.
